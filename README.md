Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset (PADS) v1.0.0
Overview
The Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset (PADS) is a comprehensive collection of sensor data gathered from smartwatch devices worn by individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and healthy controls. This dataset aims to enable research into digital biomarkers and facilitate the development of algorithms for monitoring, assessment, and early detection of Parkinson's Disease through wearable technology.
PADS v1.0.0 contains high-resolution accelerometer and gyroscope data captured during various activities of daily living and specific motor tasks, providing valuable insights into the characteristic movement patterns associated with Parkinson's Disease.

Key Features
ðŸ“± Sensor-based recordings: 2 smartwatches (left and right wrists) collecting 6-axis motion data (acceleration + gyroscope).

ðŸ§  Clinical design: Movement tasks developed by neurologists to detect subtle motor pathologies.

ðŸ“‹ Questionnaire data: Demographics, PD-specific non-motor symptoms (PDNMS), and personal medical history.

ðŸ§ª Preprocessed files: Ready-to-use 2D matrix formats for ML applications, plus preprocessing scripts.

ðŸ§¾ Structured format: Organized by patient, questionnaire, and sensor observation metadata.
