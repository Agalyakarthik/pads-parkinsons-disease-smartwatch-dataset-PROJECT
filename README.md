Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset (PADS) v1.0.0
Overview
The Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset (PADS) is a comprehensive collection of sensor data gathered from smartwatch devices worn by individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and healthy controls. This dataset aims to enable research into digital biomarkers and facilitate the development of algorithms for monitoring, assessment, and early detection of Parkinson's Disease through wearable technology.
PADS v1.0.0 contains high-resolution accelerometer and gyroscope data captured during various activities of daily living and specific motor tasks, providing valuable insights into the characteristic movement patterns associated with Parkinson's Disease.
