# **PADS: Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset** (v1.0.0)  

## **Overview**  
The Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch Dataset (PADS) is a comprehensive collection of sensor data gathered from smartwatch devices worn by individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and healthy controls. This dataset aims to support research into digital biomarkers and advance the development of algorithms for monitoring, assessment, and early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using wearable technology.  

PADS v1.0.0 includes high-resolution accelerometer and gyroscope data recorded during various daily activities and specialized motor tasks. This dataset provides valuable insights into movement patterns characteristic of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, aiding clinical research and technological innovation.
